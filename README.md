# What is this project?
This project brings together differing technologies in order to allow users to explore their public data. Users do not need to have any technical knowledge about the social media networks or how they gather or serve up information to outside users. Users also don't need to have any deep technical knowledge on how images store metadata such as GPS location. This project allows users to explore and educate themselves on exactly what they are sharing so that they can be more conscious in the future.

# Local Setup
If you decide to fork this repo you will need to set up 3 enviorment variables with your own values from the Meta Dashboard: FACEBOOK_APP_ID, INSTAGRAM_APP_ID, and INSTAGRAM_SECRET.
